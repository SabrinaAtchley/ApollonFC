# Drone Flight Controller Outline

## Module Control Flow

Need "mode" state variable, one byte should be enough.

### Input Module

- Get pilot control signals from `receiver.getControls()`

### Sensor Module

- Get sensor data
- Estimate craft state - Difficult, requires Kalman filter

### Flight Mode Module

- Take control signals and calculate target craft state
- Calculate state error based on estimated state - target state
- Send state error into appropriate mode-based PIDs - Medium
    - Error for integral runaway?
- Output process control vector

### Motor Control Module

- Take output process control vector and perform motor control matrix multiplication
- Filter signals to remove high frequency noise
- Send signals into motor ESCs

# To-Do

- Write unit tests for libraries and functions
- Implement current-sensing support
- ~~Write unit test framework and create an Arduino test suite sketch~~


# Notes/Reminders
- Consider revisting receivers.h and changing it to a zero-overhead abstraction
- ~~Was working on Vector16, which will be used for the matrix equation in the motor control module. The PIDs will output one Vector16.~~
- ~~Was working on unit tests for Vector16, added in Serial message for Buzzer errors.~~


# Rough Timeline - Test Flights by July 2024

- Ideally, I would like to be doing test flights during July 2024.
- Remaining modules:
  1. Motor control module - mixes PID outputs though the motor matrix to generate signals to send to motors
  2. ~~PID class~~
  3. Sensor fusion module
  4. Main module, including sensor initialization
